# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis using Python

This project is a data analysis and visualization task using a real-world traffic accidents dataset. It explores patterns, trends, and critical insights to help understand factors that lead to different types of accidents.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on traffic accident data
- Identify key factors that influence accident severity
- Visualize the impact of conditions like **weather**, **lighting**, and **damage level**
- Use statistical plots like **KDE plots**, **bar charts**, and **correlation heatmaps**

---

## 📂 Dataset

**File:** `traffic_accidents.csv`

This dataset includes columns such as:
- `Crash Severity`
- `Weather Condition`
- `Lighting Condition`
- `Damage Level`
- `Crash Type`
- `Speed Limit`, etc.

(Use `df.columns` in code to list all columns.)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- KDE plots to analyze distributions (e.g., crash severity)
- Bar plots to compare categories like damage levels
- Correlation matrix for numerical attributes
